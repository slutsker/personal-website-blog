    <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website. Here, you will find information on the various projects I have worked on, along with other information. Below, I will outline some of the projects I have worked on in recent years:</p>
    <h2>Web Applications</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        <a href = "http://myplan.cs.umd.edu">Graphic Advisor</a> (also known as "My Plan") - I am the lead developer, database administrator, and maintainer of Graphic Advisor, which I created for the University of Maryland College, Mathematics, and Physical Sciences Department. The project was organized by Dr. Purtilo, currently Vice Dean of CMPS. The application makes heavy use of jQuery and AJAX in order to allow users to dynamically edit their plan and see how close they are to graduating. Currently, CMPS students are required to fill out their four year plans before meeting with their advisors. The application will likely continue to spread to other colleges.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href = "http://www.ourumd.com">OurUMD</a> - I am the lead developer and database administrator of OurUMD, which is a website that assists students with planning their classes. It is written primarily in PHP and MySQL, and allows students to view potential schedules with a "Schedule Maker" algorithm, and it allows them to post reviews and look up additional information about classes.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Non-Technical Papers</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
        I have written two papers for my Government and Politics classes that employ some amount of statistical analysis, though they are probably not rigorous enough for an actual publication. I am no expert in statistics, but I present the papers I have written here for those who are interested. If you find problems with any of them, please feel free to contact me with any suggestions as I am always open to critique and feedback. The first is on the intersection of <a href = "dp.pdf">death penalty and politics</a> and I wrote it in Spring 2009 for GVPT439D (a class on the death penalty.) It's the more "professional"-looking of the two. The second is on <a href = "presidential.pdf">presidential elections</a>, and it was written in Fall 2007 for GVPT475, a class on the American presidency.
     </li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Small Inconsequential Projects</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><a href = "query_processor.zip">Query Processor</a> - This is a command-line query processor coded entirely in PHP. It has no real-world application, but it was pretty fun to write. It essentially evaluates a very, very limited set of SQL commands on a specific data format. I created it for Amol Deshpande's <a href = "http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2008/cmsc424/">CMSC424</a> in Fall 2008. 
    </li>
    </ul>
