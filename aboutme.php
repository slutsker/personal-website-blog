    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>I am a student at the <a href = "http://www.umd.edu">University of Maryland, College Park.</a> As of Spring 2009, I am a junior studying Computer Science and Government and Politics. I am uncertain about my long-term goals: I am doing a summer internship at Amazon for Summer 2009, and after graduation I may work full time as a software developer, and/or I may go to graduate school. I am also considering law school.</p>
    <p>Further note: I was born in Russia (immigrated to the United States at a young age) and my official name is Alexander Slutsker. My nickname is Sasha Slutsker, which is the name used on this website.</p>
    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
